Moose here. I'm split between Rip Dingers and Irene Fast. One is a home run titan and the other is a stolen base queen / outfield titan.
Nacho Crisp gets an honorable mention for style.

Agreed. Perry Quaker and Hieronymus Jackson are also beasts. And Buck Swiner is incredible if you develop him right, too.

As a Moose fan, I’d say Rhiannon Cannon. She’s young and a stud.

I don't like to talk about her because she abandoned my franchise team after 2 seasons. <_< I'm still bitter 15 seasons later lol.

Freebooters.
Winnie Noel for pitching, although Grace Loopinovich is a really solid reliever (still mad she left my team).
Stockton Brickhouse would be my overall pick, though. He's not quite the beast at the plate that Gunns Jackman is, but he's also not as entirely useless as Jackman is in the field. The Freebooters have the worst fucking defense.
In my opinion, the Freebooters don't have as obvious of an all-star as many other teams.

The freebooters are the default team that for whatever reason gives me the most trouble. Feels like even when I've got an absolutely stacked roster they're able to make it a tough game or steal a win.

Good question. I have just completing playing with each team that doesn't use a DH. I would have to say Mash Taters on Nemesis. He is sooooo slow running between bases but can smash that ball sooooo far.
But will update when I have finished through the rest of the teams.

Pepe Vinicio on the Moonstars. Solid defense at the keystone, good speed, and his "RBI Man" trait makes him really valuable at the plate. You can bat him in a run producing spot or use him as a pinch hitter in a high leverage spot with RISP.

Yoink Sax just murdered me in the finals, all 5 games not a single ball got behind him in center field.
I’m starting my 2nd season with the Blowfish and Marvin Steed has to be my favorite. The only times he’s not on fire has been the season openers. He averages a HR every other game.

Buzzards and Jaques O'ften. He's not their best by the numbers but for some reason I'm quieter at the plate, chase way less w him. And pretty good luck shutting down the running game with him, which is my bag aesthetically in baseball. Strong head cannon we him too, being a sort of "over-it" French Canadian Manny Ramirez type.

Wade Hobbes from the Wideloads would be my pick. The stance he has just sets me up for success, just let's me see the ball better. Constant home runs wherever I bat him and good pop overall.
On defense, his arm does enough that I can gun some runners down, which is nice. Has enough speed to run some balls down or slide for them, but average overall in that department.
And finally for base running, he can grab a bag here or there which is always appreciated. I play him in the corners to get the most out of his defense.

Sawteeth.
Pitching with the 2 headed monster of Fabio Fabulo and Melody Moody was a real joy. I played only about 12 games with the sawteeth before I moved onto a custom team/franchise but getting 2 starts each with them gets them at least an honorable mention. They were both incredibly dominant
Mind you I started on ego 30 so they both very well could be awful but even if that's the case, I'll always have a soft spot for both of them.

Henry Hampster of the Herbisaurs. His defense at third is very good (a couple of my pitchers owe him half their paychecks for all the liners down the third-base line he stabs) and his High Pitch trait makes him dangerous at the plate; he led the league in HRs and RBIs a couple of seasons ago and has enough speed to steal a base once in a while. I usually bat him second in the order.
Honorable mentions: Grunt Manly and Annabella Stokes. Manly is a solid fielder and he's a consistent run-producer thanks to his RBI Man and Tough Out traits. Stokes is very fast and can reach any ball hit to her side of the field.

Dexterez (Beewolves). Switch Hitter. Utility attribute and can do any IF/OF. Don't remember if he was already rated S but he is for me. Power, contact, speed, fielding and arm are all close to 90-99. Also very young. He left for more money elsewhere after his 5 seasons and championships.

I'm on season 2 of a sirloins franchise. Rip Dingers won the MVP due to having a lot more RBIs than my other hitters in my first season, but I love hitting with Boomer Platunne. Having a switch hitter is huge sometimes, especially one that can absolutely mash.

As a fellow Herbisaurs user, I cna attest to Yoink Sax being the heart and soul of the team. I put him first in the lineup since he's so damn good at getting on base, and then stealing after that.
Besides that, I'd say Olaff Slakov is always the pitcher I want to use, since his fastball is accurate and devastatingly fast, with a great change-up to switch it up.`;

const matches = players.filter((name) => {
  const re = new RegExp(name, "ig");
  return text.match(re);
});
console.log(matches.join(","));
